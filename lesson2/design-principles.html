    <h2>Alignment<img src="images/align.png" alt="Align"></h2>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://uxengineer.com/principles-of-design/alignment/">
    <p class="first">Although alignment is typically overlooked, without this tool a design
        would lack a sense of direction, unity, or organization. Alignment simply refers to
        how elements are placed on a page. Its purpose goes beyond organization, it is vital
        for enhancing the overall visual appeal of a design or page layout.
    <p>Designers take into
        consideration the way that people naturally scan a page when creating a product. Each
        type of alignment left, right, centered, and justified all differ in how and when you
        use them. In English-speaking countries, text is generally read from the left to the right,
        so left alignment is the most common. However, for certain purposes such as promotional,
        decorative, or in smaller bodies of text the other types are strategically utilized.</p>

    <h2>Repetition<img src="images/repi.jpg" alt="Repi"></h2>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://learn.g2.com/principles-of-design">
    <p class="second">Repetition is achieved by repeating an element more than once throughout
        a design. While this may seem simple, designers depend on the principle of repetition to
        create a feeling of organized movement and consistency within a composition. In any design,
        you will find yourself having to repeat elements, but by doing so, you'll be able to strengthen
        and unify the visual appeal of a design.
    <p>The principle of repetition can also be an important
        business tactic. The visual elements of a companies brand identity act as the face for how a company
        is perceived. Utilizing repetition is not only useful within a singular print, but can also be effective
        when it is displayed throughout a companies design portfolio. A strong logo that is repeated throughout
        social media, business cards, brochures, web design, etc., enhances a consumers experience and makes a brand
        recognizable.</p>

    <h2>Contrast<img src="images/cont.jpg" alt="cont"></h2>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.siegemedia.com/contrast-ratio?ref=frontendchecklist#%23805ba4-on-%23a0aca6">
    <p class="third">People say that opposites attract and this can be true for elements of design as well.
        Imagine a composition without contrast every color, font, shape, etc. would be the same size,
        and that design would be rather dull. Contrast is the tool that makes a design “pop,” making it memorable
        for viewers.
    <p>Contrast also aids in the usability of a composition. A designs organization is dependent
        upon how contrast is used to lead a viewers eye towards what is most important. For instance, if all
        the content within a design was the same size, how would your audience know what information is the
        most significant? Through contrast designers are able to highlight certain elements they want to emphasize,
        creating a focal point for an audience and a visual hierarchy.</p>
